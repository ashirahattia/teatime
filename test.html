                    <p>Herbal tea, or tisane, is any beverage made from the infusion or decoction of herbs, spices, or other plant material in hot water, and usually does not contain caffeine.[1] These drinks are distinguished from caffeinated true teas (black, green, white, yellow, oolong, etc., which are prepared from the cured leaves of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis), as well as from decaffeinated tea, in which the caffeine has been removed. In addition to serving as a beverage, many herbal teas are also consumed for their perceived medicinal benefits.</p>

                    <div class = "header">What is White Tea? </div>
                    <p>White tea is a lightly oxidized tea grown and harvested primarily in China, mostly in the Fujian and province. More recently it is grown in Galle (Southern Sri lanka), Taiwan, India, Northern Thailand and Eastern Nepal. </p>

                    <p> Scholars and tea merchants generally disagree as to when the first production of white tea (as it is understood in China today) began. What is today known as white tea may have come into creation in the last two centuries. White tea may have first appeared in English publication in 1876, where it was categorized as a black tea because it is not initially cooked like a green tea, to deactivate internal enzymes and external microbes. </p>

                    <div class = "header"> History of the name </div>
                    <p> The name "white tea" derives from the fine silvery-white hairs on the unopened buds of the tea plant, which gives the plant a whitish appearance. The beverage itself is not white or colourless but pale yellow.</p>

                    <p>Green tea is made from the leaves from Camellia sinensis that have undergone minimal oxidation during processing. Green tea originated in China, but it has become associated with many cultures throughout Asia, and has recently become relatively widespread in the West where black tea has been the traditionally consumed tea. </p>
                    <div class = "header"> How to Brew it </div>
                    <p> In general, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer, whereas higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter. Steeping green tea too hot or too long will result in a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of the initial quality, because it will result in the release of an excessive amount of tannins. High-quality green teas can be and usually are steeped multiple times; two or three steepings is typical. It is common practice for tea leaf to be left in the cup or pot and for hot water to be added as the tea is drunk until the flavor degrades. </p>

                    <p>In South Africa, it is common to prepare rooibos tea in the same manner as black tea and add milk and sugar to taste. Other methods include a slice of lemon and using honey instead of sugar to sweeten. </p>

                    <p>Iced tea made from rooibos has recently been introduced in South Africa, Australia, and the United States. A variant of a London Fog, known as a Cape Town Fog, can also be made using rooibos steeped in steamed milk with vanilla syrup.</p>

                    <div class = "header">What is Black Tea? </div>
                    <p>Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas, and is generally stronger in flavor. The tea is primarily made from two major species of the tea plant, the small-leaved Chinese variety plant, and the large-leaved Assamese plant.</p>

                    <p>Black tea has long been an article of trade, and compressed bricks of black tea even served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia, Tibet and Siberia into the 19th century. Although green tea has recently seen a revival due to its purported health benefits, black tea still accounts for over ninety percent of all tea sold in the West. </p>

                    <div class = "header">How to Brew it</div>
                    <p> Generally, 2.25 grams of tea per 180 ml of water, or about a teaspoon of black tea per 6 oz. cup, should be used. Black tea should be steeped in freshly boiled water. The more delicate black teas, such as Darjeeling, should be steeped for 3 to 4 minutes. Whole leaf black teas, and black teas that will be served with milk or lemon, should be steeped 4 to 5 minutes. Longer steeping times make the tea bitter (at this point, in the UK it is referred to as being "stewed"). When the tea has brewed long enough to suit the tastes of the drinker, it should be strained before serving.</p>

                    <p>Pu-erh or Pu'er is a variety of fermented dark tea produced in Yunnan province, China.[1] Fermentation is a tea production style in which the tea leaves undergo microbial fermentation and oxidation after they are dried and rolled. This process is a Chinese specialty and produces tea known as Hei Cha, commonly translated as dark, or black tea (this type of tea is completely different from what in the West is known as "black tea", which in China is called "red tea").</p>
                    <div class = "header"> How to Brew it </div>
                    <p> The tea is steeped for 12 to 30 seconds in the first few infusions, increasing to 2 to 10 minutes in the last infusions. The prolonged steeping sometimes used in the west can produce dark, bitter, and unpleasant brews. Quality aged pu'erh can yield many more infusions, with different flavor nuances when brewed in the traditional Gong-Fu method. </p>

The tea is served ice-cold and plain but may also be flavored, traditionally with raspberry, lemon,[1] or mint.[3] Sweet tea can also be made with a simple syrup[1][4] and is sometimes tempered with baking soda to reduce the drink's acidity.[3]</p>

                                <p>Matcha, is to finely milled or fine powder green tea. The Japanese tea ceremony centers on the preparation, serving, and drinking of matcha. Prior to use, matcha is often forced through a sieve in order to break up clumps. There are special sieves available for this purpose, which are usually stainless steel and combine a fine wire mesh sieve and a temporary storage container. A special wooden spatula is used to force the tea through the sieve, or a small, smooth stone may be placed on top of the sieve and the device shaken gently.</p>
